              My professional journey is a story of <strong className="text-foreground">creative passion, adaptability, and continuous growth</strong> across diverse industries and countries.

            <p className="animate-slide-in" style={{ animationDelay: '0.1s' }}>
              Part of my career was spent in the field of music industry, working as a <strong className="text-foreground">vocalist and songwriter</strong> for a few years in a jazz band and electronic experiment project.

            <p className="animate-slide-in" style={{ animationDelay: '0.2s' }}>
              My design journey began during my diploma studies as a Character & Colour-In Artist at Studio Argus, providing a strong creative foundation. After transitioning into advertising and later project management at an architect agency, I developed invaluable skills in <strong className="text-foreground">project coordination, client relations, and managing complex creative workflows</strong>.

            <p className="animate-slide-in" style={{ animationDelay: '0.3s' }}>
              Living in Egypt, I channeled my passion into education as an Art Teacher, adapting my communication skills to a unique, multicultural environment. After relocating to Australia in 2015, I re-entered the professional world as a <strong className="text-foreground">freelance graphic designer</strong>, serving diverse clients while deepening my expertise.
            </p>

            <p className="animate-slide-in" style={{ animationDelay: '0.4s' }}>
              In 2018, I stepped into art curation at Dabster Art Lounge in Bentleigh, developing a keen eye for talent and exhibition management. A year later, I co-founded the startup <strong className="text-foreground">Navis Sideralis</strong>, where I conducted in-depth research and designed solutions that directly bridged client pains with business goals.

            <p className="animate-slide-in" style={{ animationDelay: '0.5s' }}>
              Most recently, in December 2024, I joined <strong className="text-foreground">Officeworks as a Digital Engagement Designer</strong>. My ability to quickly deliver value led to my initial three-month contract being extended to nine months, contributing to significant digital projects for a leading national brand.
